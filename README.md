Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Iris dataset, a classic dataset in machine learning and statistics. 
The analysis includes preprocessing, visualization, and modeling using machine learning algorithms.

Overview
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. 
The goal of this analysis is to explore the relationships between these features and the species of iris flowers.

Content
iris.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the EDA.
iris.csv: CSV file containing the Iris dataset.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.

Installation
To run the Jupyter Notebook locally, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn

Results
The analysis includes:

Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory data analysis: visualizing the distribution of features, pairwise relationships, and class distributions.
Modeling: training machine learning classifiers (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree, random forest) to predict iris species based on features.

Contributions
Contributions to improve this analysis or add new features are welcome! Please feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests.
